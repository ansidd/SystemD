# A simple service using SystemD

In this project I created a systemD script that would run a simple python script on the bootup of the Jetson. For this I followed this [turorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19kBHgWflg0eevGFUBI6z4WOcrtqgrs4MYMAYeFJycxA/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g10835278c7f_0_5)

On the starting the Jetson arjun_midterm.py script would be run by ARJUN_SERVICE.service. The python script just prints to the standard ouput.
